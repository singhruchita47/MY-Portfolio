How to Use

1. Open the File: simply double-click the index.html file to open it in your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, etc.).

2. Navigation: Use the top navigation bar to jump between sections (About, Skills, Achievements, Contact).

Customization Guide

If you want to update the information in the future, open index.html in any text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text) and look for the following sections:

1. Profile Image: Find the <img src="..."> tag inside the "Hero Section". Currently, it uses a generated avatar. You can replace the URL with a link to your own photo.

2. Social Media Links: Search for fab fa-linkedin or fab fa-github. Change the href="#" to your actual profile URLs (e.g., href="https://linkedin.com/in/ruchita...").

3. Form: The contact form is currently a demo. To make it functional without backend code, you can use a service like Formspree. Just wrap the inputs in a form tag provided by their service.
